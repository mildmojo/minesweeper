## Multiplayer cooperative minesweeper

One player is the commander with a full view of the field. (desktop client, Unity)

Other players connect over the web with a single-square view of the world. (web, HTML5)
Players can move N/E/S/W or search their spot for a mine. On leaving a mined
space, there's a chance the mine will go off and kill the player. On detecting
a mine, there's a very small chance the player will trigger the mine and need
to be rescued by another player.

When a player finds a mine, they report it to the commander who marks the mine
on the world map. The commander and the players need to constantly coordinate
to keep from stepping on marked mines and to rescue players who have
accidentally stepped on a mine.
